# MERN-Stack-Hotel-Booking-App
This is a full-stack hotel booking application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It allows users to search for hotels, view details, and make bookings. Features include user authentication, hotel filtering by location and date, booking history, and an admin dashboard to manage listings and reservations. The frontend is developed with React and styled for responsiveness, while the backend uses Node.js and Express with MongoDB for data storage. This project is inspired by a YouTube tutorial and serves as a hands-on learning experience for building real-world MERN applications. Future updates may include payment integration.
